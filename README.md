## Introduction
Hi, I'm Mylo. I'm a software developer from the Netherlands.

### Website
I have a github.io website at https://gitmylo.github.io/, I currently don't have other websites.

### Interests
I enjoy a variety of different projects. Recently I have been interested in learning about machine learning.
* **Machine learning**
* Automation
* Entertainment
* Cyber-security

## Recent projects
### [TavernAI card lib .net](https://github.com/gitmylo/TavernAICardLib)
I decided to create a library for creating, reading, modifying and saving TavernAI cards/json files.

Features:
* Loading (`.json`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
* Saving (`.json`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
* Editing cards
* Creating new cards
* Converting cards
* Editing (**Windows only**) or replacing images in cards

### Bark text-to-speech voice cloning
After hearing about Bark text-to-speech, I was intrigued. But I kept hearing that voice cloning was not possible. Not of any significant quality, at least.

So I started digging into how Bark works. After a few days of research, I had a good understanding of Bark text-to-speech. I then used that knowledge to figure out what needed to be done in order to clone voices.

I hit a dead end, there was a model that Suno AI (The creators of Bark) has that I don't. Voice cloning wasn't possible without that model. Right?

I then came up with the idea to generate a bunch of audio with Bark. And train on that audio with the data used to create that audio.
But how would I do that? I had a very basic understanding of AI, I had no idea how neural networks and machine learning worked.

So I took a few days to figure out how basic neural network worked. The basics, weights, biases, activation functions, how activation functions work, and tried to get a rough idea of how I could train a neural network from scratch without any libraries.
With everything that I learned, I added an implementation for it in a javascript project. The best way to learn is to actually **do** the things you're learning after all.

Once I had gathered enough knowledge, it was time to create a model to train, in order to perform the step required in order to clone voices with Bark.
So I created a model, and started training. The loss went down quickly, and after just a few minutes of training, it seemed to do pretty well.
Then I tested it, and who would have guessed? It just worked first try. I had done it!
While voice cloning still isn't 100% consistent, The quality of voice cloning is unlike any previous voice cloning with Bark. Especially at the speed it does it at.
